  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Because of his work in the entertainment industry in China, Korea and the rest of the world, Jackson is proficient in a number of languages; he can fluently speak and understand Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean and English.</p>
  <p>In August 2019, Wang uploaded a photo of the Chinese flag and declared himself as "one of 1.4 billion guardians of the Chinese flag" on his official Weibo account, after a Chinese flag was removed and tossed into the Victoria Harbour during the
    2019-20 Hong Kong protests. In a January 2020 interview with Forbes, Wang introduced himself as "Jackson Wang from China" and stated: "My goal is just to put my name out on the table just to let everybody to get to know me. I want to ... let
    people know that Chinese kids are working on good music too."</p>
